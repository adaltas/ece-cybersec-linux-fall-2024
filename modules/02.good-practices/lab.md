## Part 1.CASE STUDY: INFORMATION SECURITY**

**Context:**
The NP Group is a national player in the pharmaceutical sector (revenue in 2022: 2 billion euros, net profit 200 million euros). In France, it operates from two sites:

- One site in the Paris region (headquarters and research and development (R&D))
- One site in Lyon (production)

As of 2022, the workforce consists of 3,000 employees distributed as follows:
- Administration + R&D at the Paris region site: 700 employees
- Production: 2,300 employees

A set of custom applications dedicated to its business has been developed internally. The core of the information system is hosted at the headquarters. The production site has its own local IT system. Both sites are connected via a private network. Data from the production site is transmitted to the headquarters every night.

Only a few users, whose role requires Internet access, are allowed to have it. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems have been installed. Users are not administrators of their workstations.

In the event of a failure of the IT system at the Lyon site, a backup system is triggered within 5 minutes, allowing the production to continue.

Members of the management, marketing, and sales departments are equipped with laptops, where data (emails, contractual documents, presentations, etc.) are encrypted using a strong authentication system (smart card + login + password).

All administrative data at headquarters is stored on high-availability servers in specialized facilities.

The R&D department is located in a separate building. Ultra-confidential R&D documents are stored on high-availability servers that can only be accessed from specific rooms and through a dedicated network. This independent network is not connected to the outside.

Access to buildings is restricted, and access to specific rooms is controlled (per employee and time slots).

Each workstation and server is equipped with antivirus software, updated weekly (with a 3-day delay compared to the antivirus vendor's updates).

The entire IT system is managed by NP Group staff or subcontractors working on-site (no external hosting, no external access).

**Work to be done:**
1. Analyze the state of NPâ€™s information system protection (identify risks, threats, etc.)
2. Justify the choices and solutions implemented.
3. Propose solutions in areas you consider necessary.
